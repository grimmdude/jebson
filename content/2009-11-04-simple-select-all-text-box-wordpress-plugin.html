<p>Here&#8217;s another simple WordPress plugin I came up with.  I was trying to figure out an easy way to create a text box for some song lyrics which, once clicked, selected everything inside so anyone could easily copy and past the contents.  Well, once I figured out how to make it I figured I would make it easier for others who want to do the same thing.  Hence, Simple Select All Text box was born.</p>
<p>Basically with a simple shortcode in a post or a page you can have your very own one click, select all text box.  Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a text box in a post or a page use this shortcode: [textbox rows="3"]Contents of text box[/textbox] You can obviously change the amount of rows to your liking. If rows aren&#8217;t specified it will default to 5 rows.</li>
<li>To create a text box in the sidebar, header, footer, etc. use this template tag:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;?php simple_select_textbox('# OF ROWS','WIDTH IN PX','BOX CONTENT') ?&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Upload the whole simple-select-all-textbox folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.</li>
<li>Go to the options page to adjust the width of all text boxes made using this shortcode.</li>
</ol>
