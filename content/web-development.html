<p><img class="pull-left" title="Wordpress" src="/assets/img/Wordpresslogo-300x300.png" alt="" width="118" height="118" />If you&#8217;re finding it difficult to manage your current HTML website or would like an easier way to add updates and changes without consulting an expert then you&#8217;ll probably benefit from switching your website over to the free and hugely popular CMS (Content Management Software) <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Once setup it&#8217;s very easy to use and makes your website much more scalable. Navigational menus can be setup to be easily changed on the fly or automatically add posts and pages as they are created.</p>
<p>While WordPress is an outstanding platform for blogging with public discussion, it also works great for general, page based sites. Here are some industries where having an up to date website can really make you stand out of the crowd:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Law Firms &#8211; <a title="Example of a Law Firm Website Design" href="http://grimmdude.com/psd-html/law_firm_blue/" target="_blank">Example Site</a></li>

<h2>PSD to HTML</h2>
<p>Many people are able to visualize how they would like their website to look and in turn use Photoshop to lay it out.  I can take that Photoshop file (.PSD) and turn it into a W3 valid HTML/CSS website or a WordPress theme.  I use semantic HTML coding practices to maximize readability for editing down the road, as well as search engine optimization.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of websites I&#8217;ve created from a .PSD file which could also be converted into WordPress themes:<br />
