title: Add Custom Classes to Wordpress Posts
---
<p>While developing my latest WordPress plugin, <a href="http://www.grimmdude.com/initial-letter-wordpress-plugin/" title="Initial Letter WordPress Plugin">Initial Letter</a>, I needed to figure out how to add a custom class to the post container.  While I actually didn&#8217;t end using this method I figured it would be an easy thing to share in case others were looking to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Basically it comes down to adding a filter which ties into the &#8216;post_class&#8217; hook.  Keep in mind that this will only work if the theme you&#8217;re using implements the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_class" target="_blank">post_class()</a> function, which pretty much all themes should use.</p>
<pre><code>/// Add 'initial_letter_post' class to post container
function initial_letter_plugin_class_filter($classes) {
	$classes[] = 'initial_letter_post';
	return $classes;
}

add_filter( 'post_class', 'initial_letter_plugin_class_filter');</code></pre>
