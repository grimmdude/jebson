<p>Hello!  My name is Garrett Grimm; I&#8217;m a musician, web developer, and 3D modeler when I&#8217;m feeling sporty.</p>
<p>This site is a steaming jambalaya of everything I&#8217;m passionate about.  If I do something I think is cool or useful, I&#8217;ll post it up on the blog.  If you&#8217;re in need of some help with a personal website or something clean and snazzy for your business check out the <a title="Web Design" href="http://www.grimmdude.com/web-design/">Web Design</a> link above for a full description of what I can offer plus some examples of past work I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>I write music too, which I also post up when it comes to me.  I tend to play more bluesy stuff when I&#8217;m jamming with my friends, but for some reason my recorded stuff is pretty non-genre specific.  To get a taste of my audio masterpieces check out the <a title="Some of my music" href="http://www.grimmdude.com/category/production-music/">Music</a> link at the top of this page.  I&#8217;m always open to let people use my music for free in any non-commercial media like YouTube, your blog, a school project, or whatever.  Just shoot me a <a title="Contact" href="http://www.grimmdude.com/contact/">message</a> to let me know and throw some credit up there for and I&#8217;ll be happy to help you promote it.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s all I can think of right now.  Make it rain.</p>
